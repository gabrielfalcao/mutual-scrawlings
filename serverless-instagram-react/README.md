# Serverless Instagram

This app was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app)
which also generated a [guide](GUIDE.md). (actually it generates a
README.md but I moved it to GUIDE.md in order to keep this README as
concise as possible.

## Running the app

```bash
cd serverless-instagram-react
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Here are the steps followed to create this app:

```bash
# create the app from scratch
npx create-react-app serverless-instagram-react
cd serverless-instagram-react

# install bootstrap 4.0.0
yarn add bootstrap

# install open iconic (for icons)
yarn add open-iconic

# install react-dropzone for drag-and-drop uploads
yarn add react-dropzone

# install missing dependencies
yarn add jquery popper.js
```
